#After VAR was introduced in 2018–2019, the average number of goals per match in La Liga showed a noticeable drop. The distribution of match outcomes and scoring patterns also became slightly more conservative, possibly due to increased oversight on goal-validating decisions. While most correlations between match stats remained stable, there is evidence that VAR may have had a dampening effect on goal scoring.
