#Correlation Heatmap Pre vs Post VAR
#After VAR was introduced in the Premier League, core relationships like first-half goals leading to full-time results remained strong. There was a slight drop in the correlation between home shots and goals, possibly due to more goals being overturned or reviewed. Overall, the impact on match dynamics appears subtle rather than drastic.
