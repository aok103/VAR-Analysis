#After VAR was introduced in Ligue 1 during the 2018–2019 season, average goals per match began to rise gradually. The consistency of match outcomes and scoring patterns remained largely stable, though the heatmaps suggest subtle shifts in how stats like shots and goals correlate. Overall, VAR appears to have had a moderate positive impact on scoring trends without disrupting match flow.
